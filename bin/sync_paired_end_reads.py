"""
(Re-)sync two filtered paired end FASTQ files.
Given two filtered paired end read files and one of the original read files,
re-sync the filtered reads by filtering out anything that is only present in
one of the two files.
Usage:
  {command} <orig.fq> <reads_1.fq> <reads_2.fq> \\
      <reads_1.synced.fq> <reads_2.synced.fq>
The synced reads are written to disk as <reads_1.synced.fq> and
<reads_2.synced.fq>. Afterwards some counts are printed.
Both Illumina old-style and new-style paired-end header lines are supported
and any (input or output) filename ending in .gz is assumed to be gzipped.
The original read file is used to speed up processing: it contains all
possible reads from both edited reads (in all files in the same order) so it
can process all files line by line, not having to read a single file in
memory. Some ideas were taken from [1].
